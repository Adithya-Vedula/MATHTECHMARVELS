The purpose of creating this script was to develop a tool that simplifies the complexities involved in calculating option prices, particularly using the Black-Scholes formula. Options pricing involves intricate mathematical calculations, especially when considering factors like volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates. By creating this script, I aimed to provide a straightforward solution for traders and analysts to quickly obtain option prices without having to manually perform these calculations.

The script implements the Black-Scholes formula, a widely used model for pricing European-style options. It takes inputs such as the current price of the underlying asset, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility, and returns the theoretical price of the option. Additionally, it allows users to specify whether the option is a call or a put.

One of the main motivations behind creating this script was to streamline the process of option pricing, especially for individuals who may not have a strong background in quantitative finance or programming. By encapsulating the complex mathematical calculations into a simple function, users can focus more on analyzing and making decisions based on option prices rather than spending time on manual computations.

Overall, this script serves as a valuable tool for traders, analysts, and anyone involved in options trading who seeks to reduce calculation complexities and obtain quick and reliable option prices for decision-making purposes.

Same with MACD,it includes painstaking calculations which can be easily automated.
